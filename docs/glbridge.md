# Graphics proxy quick start

## 1. What is `v86gl_pci.js`?

[`src/v86gl_pci.js`](../src/v86gl_pci.js) implements a custom virtio PCI device
in v86. It receives graphics commands from the Windows guest driver and passes
them to the browser graphics renderer, which uses WebGPU.

Enable **Enable graphics proxy (WebGPU)** in `index.html` or `debug.html`.

## 2. Get the driver and DLLs

Sources and binaries are in
[retro-gaming-site/glbridge](https://github.com/speedyHKjournalist/retro-gaming-site/tree/main/glbridge):

- `v86gl_driver/v86gl-virtio.sys`
- `openglproxy/opengl32.dll`
- `ddrawproxy/ddraw.dll`
- `d3d8proxy/d3d8.dll`
- `d3d9proxy/d3d9.dll`

## 3. Install the driver in Windows 2000/XP

Rename `v86gl-virtio.sys` to `v86gl.sys` and copy it to
`C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers`. When updating, close the game and run
`sc stop v86gl` before replacing the file.

Run these commands as Administrator:

```bat
sc create v86gl type= kernel start= demand binPath= C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\v86gl.sys

sc qc v86gl
sc start v86gl
```

The current build scripts target XP; Windows 2000 compatibility is unverified.

## 4. Install the graphics DLLs

Copy the DLLs needed by the game into the same folder as its `.exe`:
`opengl32.dll` for OpenGL, `ddraw.dll` for DirectDraw, `d3d8.dll` for Direct3D 8,
or `d3d9.dll` for Direct3D 9.

## 5. Build the driver and DLLs

Install the 32-bit MinGW-w64 toolchain (`i686-w64-mingw32-gcc`, `objdump`, and
`windres`), including its DDK headers and kernel import libraries.
From the `retro-gaming-site` repository root, run:

```sh
sh glbridge/v86gl_driver/build.sh
sh glbridge/openglproxy/build.sh
sh glbridge/ddrawproxy/build.sh
sh glbridge/d3d8proxy/build.sh
sh glbridge/d3d9proxy/build.sh
```


## 6. Tested games and applications

The following games and applications have been tested with the graphics proxy:

- **OpenGL:** GLView 2.6.0, Warcraft III (OpenGL mode), Cube 2 Sauerbraten.
- **DirectDraw:** 3DMark 99 MAX, Diablo II.
- **Direct3D 7:** 3DMark 2000.
- **Direct3D 8:** 3DMark 2001 SE, MapleStory v083.
- **Direct3D 9:** 3DMark06, KartRider, Warcraft III, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005).

## 7. Save and restore graphics state

Use `await emulator.save_state()` and `await emulator.restore_state(state)`.
The graphics adapter pauses a running guest while saving or restoring, waits
for accepted GPU work and readbacks, and resumes it after success. Saves and
restores on the same instance are serialized. A failed restore leaves the guest
stopped. `initial_state` also restores graphics before `emulator-loaded`.
Historical graphics surfaces stay hidden during reconstruction; the final
surface is revealed after replay completes. Loading still takes time proportional
to the history. Browser audio is paused during the operation. Restoring clears
audio from the discarded timeline and reapplies the saved SB16 sampling rate
before playback resumes.

Checkpoint version 3 records OpenGL, Direct3D 8, Direct3D 9 and DirectDraw batches
in order, including Present and checkpoint flush boundaries. On restore the
adapter rebuilds clean executors and replays the history. This reconstructs
resource handles, shaders, render state, palettes, queries and GPU-rendered
contents, rather than relying only on CPU upload shadows. Historical readbacks
never write to the restored guest memory. D3D8 uses an owned back buffer so
unfinished frames survive browser frame boundaries and checkpoint flushes.

Commands are copied directly into contiguous pages, avoiding allocations per
batch. In browsers, completed page buffers are transferred to a dedicated
`graphics_journal_worker.js` worker for compression, keeping that work off the
emulation thread. Deploy this file beside `libv86-webgpu.js`; `make glbridge`
generates both. Environments without workers use local compression. There is no 512 MiB raw
history cutoff. `graphics_options.graphicsJournalMemoryBytes` sets the compressed
RAM cache budget (default 64 MiB); older `maxGraphicsJournalBytes` and
`maxGLJournalBytes` options are aliases for this budget. Excess pages are stored
temporarily in IndexedDB and deleted when the emulator resets or is destroyed.
If disk caching is unavailable or its quota is exhausted, pages stay in RAM;
commands are never discarded to enforce the cache budget. Pending compression
and the current page also use memory outside this cache budget.

Saving packs all pages into a portable checkpoint; loading needs no original
browser database. It decompresses and replays one page at a time. Saving still
needs memory for the complete output, and the emulator's overall state format
uses signed 32-bit offsets. History size and restore time grow with the recorded
workload. This remains a replay checkpoint, rather than a compact snapshot of
only live resources, and GPU results need the same supported features.

Version 2 checkpoints remain readable. A running session that already exceeded
the old history cutoff must be restarted with the new code: commands discarded
by the old implementation cannot be recovered.

Version 1 checkpoints can restore only their original OpenGL/D3D8 payloads.
They never stored D3D9/DirectDraw resources or GL query lifetimes, so missing
state in those old files cannot be recovered retroactively.

Regression checks:

```sh
make test-glbridge
node tests/glbridge/gl_multipass_browser_runner.js graphics_checkpoint_browser_test.html
node tests/glbridge/gl_multipass_browser_runner.js graphics_vga_browser_test.html
node tests/glbridge/gl_multipass_browser_runner.js graphics_journal_perf_test.html
```

The browser test checks actual GPU pixels for all four APIs after restoring in
both the same and a new emulator instance, including unfinished D3D8 drawing.
