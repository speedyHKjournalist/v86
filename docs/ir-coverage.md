# IR encoding and lowering coverage

Run `make ir-coverage` for counts and `make ir-generated-check` to validate that
`ir-coverage.json` and the Rust decode catalogue match the source opcode table.
The stable encoding ID is `(opcode << 4) | (fixed_g + 1)`, using zero for an opcode
without a ModRM group. It does not depend on table ordering.

`lowering` is the **production** status. `experimental_lowering` separately records
experimental capability. Of 3,972 coarse forms, 244 explicit invalid reg/mem and missing-group forms
are BaselineUD and **3,728 production forms remain Pending**. Of those production-
Pending forms, zero remain `experimental_lowering: Pending`. Each has an
experimental native/helper path or explicit baseline behavior, including baseline
unsupported/debug-assert and release-#UD cases. This is a coarse catalogue milestone,
not full prefix/mode/exception acceptance or production-default qualification.
Current experimental capabilities are:

These counts are not completed production coverage. `make ir-default-gate`
rejects nonzero production Pending. No helper coverage is claimed simply because
an old CPU helper or emitter exists. The release runtime still uses the legacy
backend; [ir-progress.md](ir-progress.md) tracks the full migration requirements.

The forms expand catalogue operand size, address size and reg/mem selectors.
Implicit widths retain the opcode table's fixed-width classification; Rust lowering
selects the actual register fragments. Privilege/mode constraints, LOCK legality,
repeat-prefix combinations, nested x87 subopcodes, runtime feature checks and
helper-specific invalid encodings still need a more complete acceptance matrix.

The `tests` list points to the relevant fixture generator and executable suite
for each implemented family. The coverage check requires attributed paths to
exist. This navigation is not exhaustive per-form proof; actual tested dimensions
and deliberate policies are recorded in the linked contracts and
[validation report](ir-validation.md). Pending experimental forms carry no test
claim; invalid forms reference the decoder suite.

Decode facts distinguish `fetch_modrm` (the opcode family's fetch before mandatory
prefix dispatch) from `e` (the selected form's EA semantics), retaining the pinned
baseline's invalid-form lengths. Production analysis uses the catalogue's `custom`
attribute to retain helper observer boundaries. Both are covered by the actual
legacy-analyzer differential, independently of experimental lowering capability.

[CMPXCHG8B](ir-cmpxchg8b.md) adds four experimental memory forms with native
RAM execution and ordered CPU slow paths; production coverage is unchanged.

The shared interpreter rules, explicit missing groups and expanded acceptance matrix are documented in [the contract increment](ir-contract-matrix.md).
