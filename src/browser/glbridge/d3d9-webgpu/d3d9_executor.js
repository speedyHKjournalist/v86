// D9WG high-level Direct3D 9 command executor -- M1 skeleton.
//
// The guest DLL (glbridge/d3d9proxy/d3d9_proxy.c) keeps COM objects, shadow
// state, Lock/Unlock memory and batching inside Windows XP. This host owns
// only WebGPU resources and immutable cache objects, mirroring the D3D8
// path's division of responsibility (see ../d3d8-webgpu/d3d8_executor.js)
// but as an independent protocol/implementation: D9WG has its own opcode
// numbering, resource handle namespace and payload shapes (d3d9_protocol.h).
//
// M1 scope: batch decode, a resource table for vertex/index buffers, 2D
// textures and vertex declarations, WebGPU device lifecycle, and the
// fixed-function XYZ/XYZRHW draw path with no programmable shaders.
//
// M2 adds shader model 2.0: CREATE/SET_{VERTEX,PIXEL}_SHADER translated to
// WGSL by d3d9_shader_pipeline.js, the float/int/bool constant register file
// packed into a uniform buffer (plan 9.7), independent sampler state driving
// a GPUSampler cache (plan 4.4/12), and multi-stream vertex declarations.
//
// M3 finishes the fixed-function pipeline, which until then stored a great deal
// of state it never acted on: vertex lighting (SetLight/SetMaterial/
// LightEnable, computed in view space as D3D9 does), the whole D3DTOP_*
// texture-blending cascade across up to eight stages, per-stage coordinate
// selection/generation/transform, cube textures, and the scissor rect. It also
// brings render targets, depth surfaces and MRT forward from M4 -- a 2005-era
// D3D9 game renders most of its frame into textures, so without them it has no
// picture at all -- plus per-process session isolation and device-loss
// recovery, both M1 leftovers.
//
// The fixed-function and programmable paths are one path, not two. Both
// stages are always separate GPUShaderModules meeting over a fixed
// inter-stage varying contract (COLOR0/COLOR1 at locations 0-1, TEXCOORD0..7
// at 2-9, FOG at 10 -- see VARYING_* in d3d9_shader_pipeline.js), with the
// fixed-function stage synthesised into a module that obeys the same
// contract. That is what makes the mixed configurations D3D9 allows work at
// all: fixed-function T&L feeding a real pixel shader, or a vertex shader
// feeding the fixed-function texture pipeline, are both routine in games of
// this era and neither would link if each path had its own varying layout.
//
// Every other D9WG opcode already has a number reserved in d3d9_protocol.h
// for a later milestone, but the guest never emits it yet, so this executor
// does not need a handler for it -- unknown/future opcodes are skipped by
// their `size` field (see decodeCommand) rather than treated as an error,
// matching the parser-safety rule in the implementation plan's section 6.8.
//
// Protocol 1.3's batch header carries a 64-bit process session id. The
// executor switches among per-session device/resource/frame contexts at batch
// boundaries, so launchers and capability helpers may run concurrently with a
// game even though every process starts allocating the same numeric handles.

         * before Present touches the swap chain at all, which is what lets
         * finishFrame(false) submit a partial frame (see flushThreshold).

         * It is also less work than the copy pair it replaces: the previous
         * shape copied the retained image *into* the canvas texture at the

         * copied it back *out* before Present (so GetRenderTargetData had
         * something to read). Owning it makes the retained image and the render
